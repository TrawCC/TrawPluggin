# TrawPluggin (MINECRAFT DEVELOPMENT)
Useless Pluggin as Im just testing. Do not expect updates of this on any way. I used Eclipse for Java EE Developers; https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/mars/r/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to test it out, put the trawpluggin.jar inside your "pluggins" folder.

Commands Available for now and for ever (I wont be updating..)

/traw
